# Accelogix Beer List
Long live the list of beer!

## What's The Beer List?
On Friday afternoons (starting at 4 p.m. CST), employees in the Brookfield, WI Accelogix office are allowed to drink beer while they continue to work. Everyone is encouraged to participate in this tradition, and all that is asked of participants in return is that they purchase beer for the office once in a while. In order to keep things fair, we maintain a list of how many times each beer-drinker has given back to the cause. This repository is the new home for the beer list.

## How Does It Work?
If you brought in beer for the Brookfield, WI Accelogix office create an issue on this GitHub with the following template or simply let someone with push-access know the same details. Do *not* manually update the beer list in the break room! Someone with push-access will update this repository, close out the issue and print an updated beer list to be posted in the break room. One six-pack of beer will yield you one 'x' on the beer list. No (unconsumed) beer is allowed to leave the Brookfield, WI Accelogix office.
